### Details Screen
I am buiilding a restaurant/food spot bookmarking application named "Bite Marks".  It is design for users to find and bookmark restaurants. One screen is a list of saved spots, and another is details screen for each spot. 

Your task is to build an engaging restaurant/spot details screen for each restaurant. Users should be able to see the relevant restaurant details and rate the it themselves, mark it as visited, leave comments, and add social links. If there is additional functionality that would be engaging or particularly useful, you can add that also.

I want you to create FOUR different attemps.  I would like for you to put each attempt in the {{ (test) }} folder and make them pages that have styles and javascript, self contained in the +page.svelte file.  See the SvelteKit docs for routing conventions. Each design should be creative and unique from all the others that you create.
